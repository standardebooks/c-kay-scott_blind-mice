			<h2 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">VIII</h2>
			<p>After Lucy’s departure the Merwent home went from bad to worse. In times past her presence had often sufficed to prevent the more sordid expressions of the disgust and contempt which Arthur felt for Nannie, and of Nannie’s feeling of fear and distrust toward him. He now avoided being at home alone with his wife until he became almost a stranger in the house.</p>
			<p>The scandal loving people of Russellville, like the inhabitants of all small towns when similar opportunity is afforded, began to talk, and Arthur’s name was linked with that of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Low. This, in time, came to Nannie’s ears.</p>
			<p>Arthur’s law practice, now that he was put to extra expense for Lucy’s maintenance and education, barely supported the family, and Nannie began to feel the pinch of poverty more keenly, especially in the matter of her wardrobe. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Lockhart was bitter toward her daughter and made no effort toward consolation. In short, Nannie felt herself hardly used by the world.</p>
			<p>She exerted all her ingenuity, however, in making an appearance that belied her pocket book, and achieved a certain amount of success.</p>
			<p>“You could turn a good many pennies dressmaking, if you only had horse sense, Anna. Minnie could get you work among her friends. She could put it to them that it was a kind of favor, and if you’d keep your mouth shut nobody would be the worse for it,” remarked <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Lockhart one day, eyeing one of Nannie’s costumes with reluctant approval.</p>
			<p>But Nannie was very much hurt by such a suggestion. She had no desire to use her arts to teach other and more prosperous women to dress becomingly.</p>
			<p>It was evident, nevertheless, that something must be done to supplement Arthur’s earnings. She still attended social events at the “big house” as often as she could squeeze an invitation from “Cousin Minnie,” and it was to “Cousin Minnie’s” influence, rather languidly exerted in her behalf, that she applied for a solution of her problem.</p>
			<p>It came in the shape of a position in a small private school in Russellville.</p>
			<p>The school, which had existed precariously for several generations, was usually referred to as “The Academy.” A short while previously it had appeared to be almost moribund, but it had lately been taken over by one <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Walsh, called “Professor Walsh,” though he held no degree or official position; and it had, for the time being at least, awakened to unwonted patronage.</p>
			<p>Though Professor Walsh was from a nearby town, no one seemed to know much of his antecedents. He was a large slow-spoken man with a low-pitched pleasant voice. He had fat features and was rather pale. His hair, parted in the middle, was wetly and thinly combed over a glistening scalp. He had thick curveless lips. His eyes were a nondescript blue and he wore nose glasses which glittered inscrutably.</p>
			<p>He had an air of decorum and responsibility, and his smile, which displayed double rows of perfect teeth, was full of warmth and condescension. He was peculiarly apt as a listener, showed a subdued but flattering appreciation of the broad talk of men, and was earnestly sympathetic, though somewhat noncommittal, when he gave ear to the ladies.</p>
			<p>His personality was such that he impressed one, in his genial restraint, as being responsible for the group.</p>
			<p>He was enough of an enigma to overawe people and acquired the reputation of being learned. The teachers in the school were afraid of him. By patronizing some and snubbing others, and by frequent vague allusions to distinguished acquaintances and remote but exalted relations, the Professor forced the first families of Russellville, so styled by themselves, into receiving him. At the institution over which he presided Nannie gave piano lessons to the younger pupils. She rather enjoyed than disliked her task, for her position allowed her to remind Arthur that he could not support her, and besides Professor Walsh soon became interested in her and was, as she told herself, exceedingly kind and sympathetic.</p>
			<p>She also found it pleasant to meet the grown boys, or “young gentlemen,” as they were called, who attended some of the higher classes. Professor Walsh left her little opportunity to talk with these youths but their presence lent a piquancy to his attentions.</p>
			<p>She was rather afraid of him, but the envy with which the teachers looked on such signal favor as she received from this august person reconciled her to those things in his makeup which she found incomprehensible. She was further led to encourage his attentions by the fact that there was no one to contest with him the role of exclusive admirer.</p>
			<p>Professor Walsh, being of ambiguous antecedents, realized fully the advantages of a connection with some family which exemplified the southern tradition. He easily perceived that Nannie Merwent was susceptible to influence, and he hoped through her to cement an alliance with the Sheldons, the most prosperous and dictatory citizens of Russellville.</p>
			<p>Professor Walsh’s plans were not laid in a day; but, without her realizing it, he considered each circumstance of Nannie’s life as she presented it to him, and decided on its possible relation to his own future.</p>
			<p>At one of the few receptions which Arthur had felt bound to attend in Russellville, he met Professor Walsh.</p>
			<p>“I am honoured to know you, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Merwent,” remarked the educator affably, when they were introduced. “I have the deepest admiration for your profession. A⁠—ah⁠—distant connection of mine⁠—though our names are not spelt the same⁠—James <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">K.</abbr> Walshe of Chicago. You may have heard of him?”</p>
			<p>“Every lawyer knows the reputation of your relative, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Walsh,” replied Arthur. “In criminal cases he has few equals.”</p>
			<p>“In case you ever go to Chicago I shall be most happy to give you a letter of introduction to him,” offered the Professor.</p>
			<p>“Thank you,” returned Arthur, “I hardly think⁠—” Then he appeared to reconsider. “It is true that I shall probably go to Chicago in the near future, and I should be very glad to go to see your relative.”</p>
			<p>“Well, sir, you shalt have the letter.” The Professor compressed his lips, put the tips of his fingers together and regarded Arthur curiously. “Without fail. I will send it to your office tomorrow,” he added.</p>
			<p>“Thank you,” repeated Arthur. And the two separated.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Nannie, on one of the rare occasions when Arthur was at home, sneeringly alluded to his attentions to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Low.</p>
			<p>“You will kindly not interfere with the conduct of my personal affairs while you are so careless of your own,” he requested in a tone that closed the conversation.</p>
			<p>A few days later the gossips of Russellville were informing their friends that <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Low had gone to Chicago for an indefinite stay. Nannie at once wrote furiously to Lucy accusing her of plotting with deliberate intent to wreck her mother’s life.</p>
			<p>Nannie’s accusations were so obviously ill founded that the only recourse left for Lucy’s wounded pride was silence, and she made no reply to a succession of violently worded letters.</p>
			<p>Arthur appreciated in part the difficult situation in which his daughter was placed, and did his best to prevent her being drawn into this conflict. It was not long after <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Low’s arrival in Chicago that Lucy learned that her father was spending most of his time in the state capital, where he was making important legal affiliations. In this way Nannie, left almost entirely to herself, began to depend more and more on the benevolent Professor, who showed a reserved but unfailing interest in her affairs.</p>
			<p>He had a way of regarding her enigmatically through his twinkling glasses that made her always a little afraid of him, but he was also always able to impress other people, and her cautious instincts prompted her to lean toward his poise and aplomb while her vanity still further urged her to his conquest. Nannie was not unaware of the fact that the town had begun to comment on her association with him but her terror of being alone was greater than her habit of caution.</p>
			<p>One evening after leaving school, a note from the Professor was delivered to her, in which he suggested that she come to the school building that night, as he had heard some rumors of Arthur’s doings which he thought she should know.</p>
			<p>Nannie dressed herself and went out without hesitation, but she was careful to find her way along obscure streets and hoped fervently that neither “Cousin Minnie” nor her other relatives would hear of the visit.</p>
			<p>The Academy was a large old fashioned red brick building with many additions and one wing which had a private entrance in a little-frequented lane where the Professor’s office was situated.</p>
			<p>As Nannie came up the walk she could see his large shadow as he bent over his desk between the window and the light. She rang the bell at the side door and he himself admitted her. For some reason which she could not explain she felt at first an unusual discomfort in his presence, and, when he leaned forward and took her hand in a kind but casual manner, her heart gave a sudden leap and she glanced up at him suspiciously. However, he patted her shoulder comfortingly, and, as he repeated to her in a low tone some incidents of gossip about Arthur which had lately come to his ears, she was completely reassured. She was certain that he admired her tremendously, and she was determining in her heart that she would use his devotion as a weapon of defense against the continual disapprobation of “Cousin Minnie.”</p>
			<p>Professor Walsh talked so long and so comfortingly that Nannie was startled when she looked at a clock on his book shelf and realized that she had allowed herself to remain until an hour which Russellville would consider scandalous. When Professor Walsh offered to escort her home she protested vehemently. If he were seen walking with her at such a time it might rob her of the position of an injured party which was what she desired the world to permit her in view of Arthur’s neglect.</p>
			<p>It was a terrible moment for Nannie when she had told the Professor good night and walked into the street, only to find herself confronted at the very gate by a strange man who stepped up to her with an air of quiet determination and inquired if she were <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Merwent.</p>
			<p>“Y⁠—yes,” stammered Nannie doubtfully, terror clutching her throat, though she was unable to conceive of what was about to happen.</p>
			<p>“Why yes, this is <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Merwent,” affirmed a brisk masculine voice as, from the deep shadow thrown by the Academy walls, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Blair, Arthur’s colleague in several law cases, stepped out, followed by Arthur himself and another strange man.</p>
			<p>Nannie, though technically guiltless of wrongdoing, was almost in a state of collapse and, scarcely knowing what she did, agreed to cooperate in the arrangements Arthur desired for a divorce.</p>
			<p>Only once during the conversation, which was carefully listened to by all of Arthur’s companions, did she weakly demur; whereupon he coldly declared he would bring suit on a graver charge, would not shrink from publicity and would use the incident of the night to prove his case, as the two men unknown to her were reputable witnesses.</p>
			<p>Nannie was conquered.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>After a few days of reflection, however, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Merwent persuaded herself that her husband could never bring himself to the point of taking the step he contemplated.</p>
			<p>The scene which followed the actual filing of Arthur’s suit for divorce, therefore, was no worse than numerous other scenes to which she had treated her husband at frequent intervals throughout their married life, many of them precipitated by trifles.</p>
			<p>When she perceived that rage, abuse, and sarcasms all failed to affect Arthur’s calm, she grew really frightened and began to weep hysterically.</p>
			<p>Arthur gazed at her still unmoved.</p>
			<p>As a last resort she referred pathetically to their life together.</p>
			<p>“You can’t mean that you will carry this thing through, Arthur!” she moaned. “For Lucy’s sake you can’t do such awful things.”</p>
			<p>His sudden cold fury was terrible.</p>
			<p>“For Lucy’s sake,” he repeated slowly and gratingly, “after you have driven her out of the house and poisoned her youth! Yes, it would be highly appropriate for us to stay together for Lucy’s sake.”</p>
			<p>“Arthur, I can’t believe that you hate me that much!” Nannie pleaded. “You don’t hate me, do you?”</p>
			<p>“I can’t put my feelings into words,” he answered mercilessly. “You poison the air. I wonder the flowers don’t die as you pass by.” His tone was coldly implacable and he did not raise his voice.</p>
			<p>She gazed at him an instant with silent and helpless animosity.</p>
			<p>“You cruel monster!” she shrieked, springing suddenly from her chair.</p>
			<p>Arthur turned on his heel and went out.</p>
			<p>Nannie’s first act following this interview with her husband was to see Professor Walsh. Since Lucy’s rebellion she had grown afraid of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Lockhart’s comments on family difficulties. Nannie felt that the Professor’s accidental role in her embarrassment constituted a sort of obligation on his part.</p>
			<p>Their meetings of late had been slightly constrained. But once in his private office he listened gravely and kindly to her agitated story.</p>
			<p>Without much having been said on either side Professor Walsh had understood for some time from <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Sheldon that the family would not look unkindly on the prospect of someone eventually taking Nannie off their hands.</p>
			<p>“My advice is that you do not contest the suit,” he said, when she had finished, “but I should try to get him to agree to something for your support if I were you, Anna. This could be done amicably and out of court. It is no more than right that he should do something for you financially.”</p>
			<p>Nannie had not noticed that he called her by her given name and broke in with, “But, Professor Walsh⁠—”</p>
			<p>“Call me Edward, Anna,” he interrupted, taking her hand.</p>
			<p>She tried to withdraw her hand but he retained it.</p>
			<p>“We are such good friends,” he continued. “Aren’t we, Anna?”</p>
			<p>“Yes,” she admitted uncomfortably.</p>
			<p>“Well, it is agreed then. I should refuse to talk about it to others if I were you. And anything new that may come up you will let me know at once, won’t you, dear?”</p>
			<p>“Yes⁠—Edward,” answered Nannie, hesitating slightly, somewhat bewildered by the new aspect which her affairs had taken.</p>
